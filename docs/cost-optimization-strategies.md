# 💰 AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

Efficient cloud usage not only boosts performance but also reduces unnecessary spending. This guide outlines key strategies for optimizing your AWS infrastructure costs.

---

## 📊 1. Monitor & Analyze with AWS Cost Explorer

- Enable AWS Cost Explorer to visualize spend.
- Use cost allocation tags to identify high-spend resources.
- Create budgets and alerts for thresholds.

---

## 💤 2. Remove Idle Resources

- Terminate unused EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and Elastic IPs.
- Delete unattached load balancers or stopped RDS instances.

---

## 📉 3. Rightsize Instances

- Use AWS Compute Optimizer or CloudWatch metrics.
- Switch instance types based on actual usage (e.g., t3.micro → t3a.nano).
- Use auto-scaling groups to scale on demand.

---

## 📦 4. Leverage Savings Plans & Reserved Instances

- Commit to 1- or 3-year terms for predictable workloads.
- Use Compute Savings Plans for flexibility across instance families.

---

## ☁️ 5. Use Spot Instances

- Ideal for fault-tolerant, stateless workloads.
- Can reduce compute costs by up to 90%.

---

## 🧼 6. Optimize S3 Storage

- Use lifecycle policies to transition data to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., Glacier).
- Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering or compression.
- Delete old versions and unnecessary objects.

---

## 🛠️ 7. Review & Optimize Networking

- Analyze VPC Traffic Mirroring and flow logs.
- Reduce cross-AZ or inter-region traffic when possible.

---

## 🧪 8. Use Cost-Aware Architecture

- Consider serverless (Lambda) for event-driven workflows.
- Use managed services (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB) to reduce ops overhead.

---

## 🔐 9. Enable Cost Allocation & Governance

- Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs).
- Delegate budget tracking and enforce tagging best practices.
